# 💻 Systems Programming Lab

This repository serves as my technical laboratory for low-level development, memory management, and system automation. I focus on the intersection of hardware efficiency and software logic.

## 🚀 Active Modules:

### [📁 C Systems Programming](./C)
This is my primary laboratory where I document my progress from **Foundations** to **Academic Projects** and **Discrete Mathematical Research**. 
- **Milestones:** Multi-file linkage, custom build systems, and recursive logic.
- **Language:** C (POSIX compliant).
## [📁 C++ Systems Lab](./Cpp)
Projects developed during my **1st Year, 2nd Semester**. This module focuses on object-oriented architecture and algorithmic problem-solving.
- **Milestones:** Manual Heap memory management, Constructor Overloading, and Arithmetic pattern generation.
- **Language:** C++17.

### [📁 Linux Administration](./Linux-Administration)
Focuses on enterprise-level system management. 
- **Lab 01:** Storage Management (Partitioning, File Systems, and Persistent Mounting). 


### [📁 Bash Automation Lab](./Bash)
A collection of 30+ scripts focused on system administration, interactive tools, and shell logic.
- **Highlights:** HTML Report Generation, Privilege-aware Admin Helpers, and POSIX Input Validation.
- **Tools:** Bash, Sed, Awk, Regex.
