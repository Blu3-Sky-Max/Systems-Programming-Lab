# 💻 Systems Programming Lab

This repository serves as my technical laboratory for low-level development, memory management, and system automation. I focus on the intersection of hardware efficiency and software logic.

## 🚀 Active Modules:

### [📁 C Systems Programming](./C)
This is my primary laboratory where I document my progress from **Foundations** to **Academic Projects** and **Discrete Mathematical Research**. 
- **Milestones:** Multi-file linkage, custom build systems, and recursive logic.
- **Language:** C (POSIX compliant).
## [📁 C++ Systems Lab](./Cpp)
Projects developed during my **1st Year, 2nd Semester**. This module focuses on object-oriented architecture and algorithmic problem-solving.
- **Milestones:** Manual Heap memory management, Constructor Overloading, and Arithmetic pattern generation.
- **Language:** C++17.

## 🛠️ Upcoming Research:
- **Bash:** Linux automation and shell optimization.
- **RHCSA:** Enterprise-level Linux administration and security.
