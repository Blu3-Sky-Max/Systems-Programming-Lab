# 📁 C Systems Programming Laboratory

This directory contains my core implementations in C, spanning from initial foundations to advanced mathematical research and academic projects.

## 🛠️ Lab Categories:

### 1. [🌱 00-Foundation](./00-Foundation)
The "Systems Genesis" - focused on multi-file linkage and the GCC toolchain.

### 2. [🎓 Academic-Coursework](./Academic-Coursework)
Official engineering labs from Altınbaş University, including student billing systems and build automation.

### 3. [🧮 Recursion-Research-Math211](./Recursion-Research-Math211)
A deep dive into Discrete Mathematics implemented through recursive C logic.

---
**Focus:** Memory management, pointer logic, and computational efficiency.
