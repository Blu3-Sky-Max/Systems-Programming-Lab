# 🏛️ Student Billing & Management System

This project was developed during my **1st Year of Computer Engineering**. It is a CLI-based application designed to manage student financial records, billing cycles, and report generation.

## 🛠️ Features
- **Student Enrollment:** Dynamic entry of student IDs, names, and academic levels.
- **Financial Tracking:** Automated calculation of tuition fees, textbook costs, and uniform fees.
- **System Integration:** Includes a **Makefile** for automated builds and a `make install` script to deploy the utility to `/usr/local/bin/`.

## 🚀 Technical Skills Demonstrated:
- **C Programming:** Input validation, data structures (structs), and formatted output.
- **Linux Systems:** Leveraging the `/usr/local/bin` hierarchy to turn a project into a system-wide command.
- **Build Automation:** Managing compilation flags and installation paths via a Makefile.
