# 🧮 Arithmetic Logic Renderer (C++)

This module implements a terminal-based pattern generator. Rather than simple drawing, the project focuses on **Coordinate Arithmetic** and conditional logic within nested loops.

## 🛠️ Implementation Logic
The "Hollow Square" is rendered by evaluating the arithmetic position of each character:
- **Condition:** If the current index satisfies the boundary equation (Row 0, Row N, Column 0, or Column N), an asterisk is rendered.
- **Arithmetic:** Uses loop-index comparison to manage spatial distribution in the CLI.

## 🚀 Technical Goal
To master the translation of mathematical constraints into functional C++ code. This serves as a foundation for more complex coordinate-based algorithms in my **Computer Engineering** studies.
